# Frank

Frank is an app for the typical electricity consumer. The iOS app is still in development, and an android app prototype will be 
available soon. Frank tells you when your next electric bill/contract is due, and lets you know of any late fees that you have.
Frank also finds electric meters near you, and compares their value. Frank can make your life easier by charting out your spending,
and identify your highest spending point over the elapse of one month. You may also sell back unused electricity to your 
contracted electric company.

### Features
